## Title - Classical vs. Jazz representation at the Smithsonian Institute  
  
With this visualization I want to explore the disparity between the representation of classical music instruments/artifacts and jazz music instruments/artifacts. This will include a look at the amount of instruments used for classical music (violins, violas, oboes, etc.) and jazz music (saxophones, drum sets, trumpets, etc), sheet music scores, and physical copies of records. I will mainly be looking at the sheer amount of each of these categories, for example: there are 100+ violins, but about 15 saxophones in the archives at the Smithsonian. I want to see if this disparity can be explained by the difference in ages of these genres, or possibly the interests of the presumably white, wealthy donors of the Smithsonian museums. The visualizations will include a geographical heatmap and a grid of photos of artifacts. Both of these methods  serve to highlight the disparity between amounts of artifacts between classical and jazz music.  
  
## Title -- Space Rocks at the Smithsonian. An interactive play experience  
  
This visualization will highlight the sheer amount of meteorites housed by the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. There are over 2,500 meteorites available with images from the Smithsonian Institute website search feature. I want to inspire curiosity and wonder at the weight and size differences of all these artifacts, and I plan on doing so with custom interactive visualizations. One will have a “pile” of all meteorites available, showing their size and allowing the user to drop the artifacts into a double pan balance scale, which will react based on which meteorites the user decides to drop into it. Another will be a sliding visualization, similar to the “Scale of the Universe” web app, and will allow the user to zoom in and out to view progressively smaller and larger meteorites.  
  
##Title -- Wartime Propaganda Posters. What similarities do they share?  
  
This visualization project will showcase the amount of wartime propaganda posters manufactured by the US government from WW2 to the end of the Cold War Era. The quantitative properties I believe would be interesting to show would be the sheer amount of posters created, the production of these posters over time, as well as analysis of the Smithsonian’s curated descriptions of these posters. I want to know how many posters depict bombs, Japanese imagery, nazi imagery, etc. and I want to know which of these descriptive words are likely to be paired together. There are over 4,000 posters with images in this dataset, but I would probably need to scrape most of them instead of getting them from the API. This project would include a scrollable gallery of images, a bar graph depicting poster production over time, a geographic heat map depicting where these posters are mainly manufactured, and a bubble graph depicting the amount of related words to the user’s search.
